== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this protect my content? =

The plugin adds special meta tags that AI companies recognize. These tags declare your licensing terms and payment requirements. When AI companies crawl your site, they must either pay your rate or skip your content.

= Will this affect my SEO or search rankings? =

No! The plugin only affects AI training bots, not search engines. In fact, our optional robots.txt feature specifically allows Google, Bing, and other search engines while blocking AI scrapers.

= How do I get paid? =

Use the new ‚ÄúCreate account & connect‚Äù button inside the plugin. A magic link email logs you into your dashboard instantly, where you can add payout methods (PayPal, Venmo, Stripe). Earnings accumulate under your domain name even before you register ‚Äì you won't lose any revenue!

= What's the difference between public and private distribution? =

‚Ä¢ **Private**: AI can use your content for individual users only (like answering a single person's question)
‚Ä¢ **Public**: AI can use your content for commercial purposes (like generating content for many users)

You can charge different rates for each type of usage.

= Can I set different prices for different posts? =

Yes! While you set a global default in Settings, you can override the license on any individual post or page using the "AI License Override" meta box in the editor.

= Do AI companies actually pay? =

Major AI companies are increasingly respecting content licenses as legal pressure mounts. News Corp's $250M OpenAI deal proves the model works. As more creators join the network, compliance increases.

= Is this compatible with caching plugins? =

Yes! The meta tags are added at the PHP level, so they work with all major caching plugins including WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, and WP Super Cache.

= Can I block all AI without setting prices? =

Absolutely. Just set the policy to "Deny" and all AI usage will be blocked. You can also use our robots.txt generator for additional protection.

= What AI companies does this work with? =

The plugin uses industry-standard meta tags recognized by:
‚Ä¢ OpenAI (ChatGPT)
‚Ä¢ Anthropic (Claude)
‚Ä¢ Google (Bard/Gemini)
‚Ä¢ Meta (Llama)
‚Ä¢ Perplexity
‚Ä¢ Any MCP-compatible system

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. The plugin is highly optimized and only adds a single meta tag to your HTML head. There's virtually no performance impact.

= What if I already have a robots.txt file? =

The plugin's robots.txt feature is optional. If you already manage robots.txt through your server or another plugin, you can leave this feature disabled.

= Do I need to leave WordPress to connect? =

No. Enter your email in the new account section and we send a magic link. Once you click it, your WordPress site is connected automatically ‚Äî no copy-pasting tokens required.
