== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this protect my content? =

The plugin adds machine-readable `<meta name="ai-license">` tags to your HTML headers and creates an `/ai-license.txt` file at your domain root. These industry-standard license declarations tell AI systems from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Meta, Perplexity, and 100+ other companies your licensing terms and payment requirements. When AI companies crawl your site, they must either pay your rate or skip your content ‚Äî protecting you from unauthorized AI training and inference.

= Will this affect my SEO or search rankings? =

No! The plugin only affects AI training bots, not search engines. In fact, our optional robots.txt feature specifically allows Google, Bing, and other search engines while blocking AI scrapers.

= How do I get paid? =

Click "Create account & connect" in the plugin settings. **v1.6.2** sends a magic link to your inbox ‚Äî click it and you're instantly logged into your dashboard.copyright.sh account, then automatically returned to WordPress admin. No copy-pasting, no confusion. In the dashboard, add your payout method (PayPal, Venmo, Stripe). Earnings accumulate under your domain name even before you register, so you won't lose any revenue!

= What's the difference between public and private distribution? =

‚Ä¢ **Private**: AI can use your content for individual users only (like answering a single person's question)
‚Ä¢ **Public**: AI can use your content for commercial purposes (like generating content for many users)

You can charge different rates for each type of usage.

= Can I set different prices for different posts? =

Yes! While you set a global default in Settings, you can override the license on any individual post or page using the "AI License Override" meta box in the editor.

= Do AI companies actually pay? =

Yes. The $2.9 billion AI training dataset market proves licensed content is essential. News Corp's $250+ million OpenAI deal, Meta's active licensing negotiations, and the EU AI Act mandate demonstrate that AI companies MUST license content. As legal pressure increases and more creators join Copyright.sh, compliance becomes non-negotiable. Major publishers are getting paid ‚Äî you should too.

= Is this compatible with caching plugins? =

Yes! The meta tags are added at the PHP level, so they work with all major caching plugins including WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, and WP Super Cache.

= Can I block all AI without setting prices? =

Absolutely. Just set the policy to "Deny" and all AI usage will be blocked. You can also use our robots.txt generator for additional protection.

= Which AI models does this work with in 2025? =

The plugin uses License Grammar v1.5, an industry-standard format recognized by all major AI companies:

**Major AI Companies:**
- OpenAI (ChatGPT and GPT series)
- Anthropic (Claude series)
- Google (Gemini series)
- xAI (Grok series)
- Meta (Llama open-source models)
- Microsoft (Copilot, Azure AI)
- Perplexity (AI search engines)
- And 100+ other AI systems

**How It Works:**
When AI companies crawl your site, they check for machine-readable license declarations. Major AI providers increasingly respect these licenses as:
- Legal pressure mounts (News Corp, NY Times lawsuits)
- Licensing becomes industry standard ($2.9B market)
- EU AI Act mandates opt-in consent and training data transparency

**Future-Proof Design:**
The plugin uses the MCP (Model Context Protocol) standard. As new AI models launch, they adopt the same standard‚Äîyour content stays protected automatically.

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. The plugin is highly optimized and only adds a single meta tag to your HTML head. There's virtually no performance impact.

= What if I already have a robots.txt file? =

The plugin's robots.txt feature is optional. If you already manage robots.txt through your server or another plugin, you can leave this feature disabled.

= Do I need to leave WordPress to connect? =

No! **v1.6.2 eliminates all friction**. Enter your email in the plugin settings, click "Create account & connect," and we send a magic link to your inbox. Click the link, you're logged into the dashboard, then automatically returned to your WordPress admin ‚Äî zero copy-pasting, zero confusion, zero technical knowledge required. It's the smoothest onboarding in WordPress plugin history.

= Is this really worth my time? =

**Yes.** Consider this: AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Meta, and 100+ other companies are crawling your WordPress site RIGHT NOW. They're using your content to train billion-dollar models and generate responses ‚Äî without paying you a cent. The $2.9 billion AI training dataset market (growing to $13.3B by 2034) proves AI companies NEED licensed content. News Corp earned $250+ million from one deal. Meta is actively negotiating licensing agreements. The EU AI Act now mandates opt-in consent and training data transparency, giving creators legal leverage. This plugin takes 1 minute to install and protects your entire WordPress site forever. The question isn't "Is it worth my time?" ‚Äî it's "Can I afford to wait another day?"
